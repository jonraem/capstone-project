# capstone-project
This is a web application for the University of Turku Capstone course. In the project we are creating a video surveillance system that uses Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi camera. The pictures and video are uploaded to an AWS server (EC2) and pulled to this website from the server.

### How to start:
* Install Node.js and npm from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Duplicate environment file `.env.example` into `.env` and add the actual keys required for authentication. (If necessary.)
* Run `yarn && yarn start` to install dependencies and boot up the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
